**Formatting Rules:**
1.  **Tables**: Must be output in **Markdown** format.
2.  **Math Formulas**: Must be output in **LaTeX** format (inline `$...$`, block `$$...$$`).
3.  **All Other Content**: Must strictly follow the original line breaks, indentation, and layout.

**Naming Rules:**
1.  **Extract Question Numbers**: Identify all question numbers.
2.  **Format Number Prefix**:
    - Single number (e.g., 16) -> "16"
    - Consecutive range (e.g., 16, 17, 18) -> "16-18"
    - Non-consecutive (e.g., 1, 2, 5) -> "1,2,5"
3.  **Summarize Topic**: Create a concise Chinese topic summary of 5 to 10 characters.
4.  **Combine**: Join the formatted number prefix and the topic with an underscore `_`.
5.  **Pure Output**: Your response must only be the final combined filename string.

**Examples:**
- Input text contains questions 16, 17, 18. Topic is multi-domain choice questions -> Output: `16-18_多领域选择题解答`
